                <h1>What is the COVID-19 Surveillance System?</h1>
                <ul>
                The COVID-19 Surveillance System was created to provide clarity, governance, relief, and ease to the student and faculty life within the campus in the midst of the current pandemic. Our plan is to create a miniature yet feature-packed device that can be monitored wirelessly and get substantial information about pedestrians coming in and out of the building. The live update of the building occupnacy is shown on this website to help students, instructors and Public Safety monitor the amount of people allowed inside the building, to practice social distancing. To keep everyone safe within the building, the device is be capable of identifying individuals who may fall within the ill category to stop the unnecessary spread of COVID-19 as much as possible. Some individuals may not be aware that they fall into that threshold, putting other at risk with spreading this virus infection. This device will be able to identify such an event, through high body temperature monitoring, and inform security personnel. The current widespread of the pandemic has caused panic and chaos within the whole world and our goal is to attain as much information within the building’s rights to keep those who are vulnerable; safe and healthy.

                <h1>Our  Innovative Technology</h1>
                The main objective of the project for us was to find a way to keep students, instructors and visitors safe before entering a building.
                This will be achieved by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Tracking movement going in and out of the building</li>
                    <li>Temperature checking to make sure nobody with high temperatures is entering the building</li>
                    <li>Using facial recognition software to help identify a suspected sick individual and alert security personnel
                        while ensuring privacy</li>
                    <li>Creating a higher level of access on web page for security personnel to monitor live data</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Facial Recognition</h1>
                    <ul>
                    Facial recognition is a complex method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their faces. Facial recognition systems are capable of identifying people in photos, videos, and in real-time. This method is a category of biometric security by using technology capable of running millions of deep and complex algorithms to classify facial features. Today, many government officials and educational institutions now require the use of facial coverings in public to protect everyone’s health as these masks are the best defense against COVID-19. These face masks are greatly adding consistencies to facial detection and recognition algorithms by simply blocking half of the facial features. The operations of facial recognition technology can be generalized as such:
                    </ul>
                        <li>Step 1: Face Detection</li>
                        <li>Step 2: Face Analysis</li>
                        <li>Step 3: Data Conversion</li>
                        <li>Step 4: Comparison</li>
                    <ul>
                    Two existing ideas of methods were used in locating the coordinates of the faces in an image on behalf of faster speeds and quality search, which is then heavily modified to account for the world we currently live in today where everyone is wearing masks. The methods used were a deep learning method of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a deep  metric learning of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). An image classification algorithm is used as the main infrastructure for the facial recognition model. A facial detection algorithm is used to extract the location and coordinates of the person from an image in case of anomalies and multiple people within the same image. This is followed by a the facial recognition algorithm, based on a Regional-Based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), which excels at image and pattern recognition in images based on color, size, shape and fill similiarities. The facial coverings reduce the accuracy of this framework by removing most of the facial features used on facial recognition pipelines. To account for this, the  RCNN was also trained using synthetic data of individuals with and without facial coverings, through 100 iterations and evaluated on real images where a facial covering is present to ensure 98% accuracy.
